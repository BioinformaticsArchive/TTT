NOTICE: TTT is currently broken. 

Plos Computational Biology paper got published earlier than we expected. We are working non-stop to have it ready as soon as possible. 
If you want us to send you a mail whenever the software is ready (early May 2015) write us to rodrigo.cilla AT tufts.edu

Important. Currently TTT does not compile with ITK versions greater than ITK 4.6 and VTK versions greater than 6.1. We are working to fix it as soon as possible.
